 * Pre-condition: The previous program made this calculation using bottom to top design.
 * It also used values instead of methods. 
 */

/*
 * Post-Condition: This program tries to implement good style to the resolution

 * Previous program can be seen at Quadratic.java program in this folder.

 * step 1: calculate the value under the square root.
 * step 2: calculate the value above the under score.
 * step 3: divide the above value with the value below.
