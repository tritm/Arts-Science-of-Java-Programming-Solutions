# Arts-Science-of-Java-Programming-Solutions
This repository is made so I can post some of the Arts and Science Programming exercises I have been making and copying from others. I hope this can help
someone out there. Or people can come here to correct and propose new kinds of solution. Cheers.

All exercises proposed by Eric S. Roberts in his book Arts and Science of Java. I do not hold any rights to his work.
